# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Melisa

âœ¨ I'm passionate about languages and technology. What began as a hobby coding in C transformed into formal education in frontend development at Noroff, which I have recently completed. I'm fully focused on mastering JavaScript and its frameworks, particularly React and SvelteKit. However, I'm also interested in exploring backend languages as I found them to be a lot of fun. In addition to my programming journey, I'm an avid Duolingo enthusiast, teaching myself Polish and Japanese. âœ¨
